            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>To the Reader.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a maxime both in Divinitie and Philosophie, that all vertues are cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenated, and have an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and dependance one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other; but these two, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Equitie,</hi> are more eminent and excellent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: So that, as it is said of the one, that <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the whole Law:</hi> So it may likewise be said of the other,
<pb facs="tcp:37680:3"/>that <hi>Justice</hi> is the fulfilling of the whole <hi>Law.</hi> For Justice is a giving to every one his due: and he that gives God his due, and his neighbour his due, doth all things which both the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
                  <p>But this is one thing makes this world so bad, that as our <hi>love</hi> is cold, so our <hi>Justice</hi> is blinde. I confesse <hi>Justice</hi> by the Ancient <hi>Painters</hi> is well represented with a <hi>Sword</hi> in the one hand, signifying the punishment of <hi>Vice;</hi> and with a pair of <hi>Balances</hi> in the other, shewing the <hi>Equity</hi> which ought to be in all our dealings one towards another; but I
<pb facs="tcp:37680:3"/>like not the <hi>Veile</hi> wherewith they hide her eyes, since she ought rather to be Eagle-sighted. I know they would intimate hereby the impartiall eye of <hi>Justice,</hi> that it should be no respecter of persons: but I fear it may more fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, that our <hi>Justice</hi> is often blinded with the <hi>Veil</hi> of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and more often with the mantle of <hi>selfe-love.</hi> Both these Veils I am sure must be taken away, or else <hi>Justice</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do its Office.</p>
                  <p>As for that of <hi>selfe-love,</hi> it is not my taske to meddle with it; only I desire all men to follow that Rule of our Lord and Saviour, <hi>to do to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="tcp:37680:4"/>as they would be dealt withall,</hi> and not those worldly maximes, <hi>to make the best of their own; and let the buyer look to himself, as well as he can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the veil of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> I have endeavoured what I can to take it away by this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; for considering the many ways whereby most men are apt to deceive both themselves and others in the way of purchasing <hi>Land</hi> or Leases, and the few instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are extant to direct them, together with their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity; I have as plainly and briefly as I could, by these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Tables,</hi> set before you the true value of
<pb facs="tcp:37680:4"/>any kinde of Purchase; so that, if men will not be wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, they may easily walk in the paths of <hi>Justice,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wandering there from.</p>
                  <p>And to make you more heedful hereof, you shal finde, that if you will depart from those Rules, grounded 'upon Art and Reason, you may as well deceive your self as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by your own ignorance, thinking that you buy a good <hi>bargain,</hi> or fell at a good <hi>rate,</hi> when you do the contrary.</p>
                  <p>It were to be wished if some such <hi>Rules</hi> as these were at least countenanced and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, (if not established and confirmed) by publique <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:37680:5"/>But I hope the <hi>Truth</hi> is so plain and strong of it self, that it needs it not; neither shal I aspire after any such publike honour. It's enough for me that I have had your private acceptance of my former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, &amp; therefore I thought my self engaged to this second Edition; which I hope I have made more plain and useful, by adding and enlarging many particulars, which then I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time to do. So that now it will be of more general use to all sorts of men, Landlords, and Tenants, Merchants and Artificers. And though it may be hard to please all, yet I hope none will be justly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
<pb facs="tcp:37680:5"/>herewith; my chief purpose herein, being to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct those who are ignorant, to beware of the craft and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness of others; and of the false rules they reckon by, that so all men may have a true and equal profit (as neer as might be) in all these kinde of Bargains.</p>
                  <p>And so once again, desiring your favourable acceptance, I rest,</p>

                  <p>First, to the Law, to make the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain sure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to Reason and Iudgement, to know the nature of that you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, to Arithmetick, to finde out the true value.</p>
                  <p>My chief purpose herein is to speak of this last, referring you in the other two, to your own judgement, and the counsell of others: yet because I am loath to let those who need some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions herein, and will be willing to learn, go altogether without, I shall briefly speak somwhat to each of these.</p>
                  <p>And in the first place, as to matter of Law, take it as I finde it summed up in these Verses.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>First, see the Land which thou intend'st to buy,</l>
                     <l>Within the Sellers Title clear doth lie;</l>
                     <l>And that no Woman to it doth lay claim,</l>
                     <l>By Dowry, Joynture, or some other name</l>
                     <l>That may it cumber. Know if bond or free</l>
                     <l>The Tenure stand, and that from each Feoffee</l>
                     <l>It be released. That th' Seller be so old,</l>
                     <l>That he may lawfull sell, thou lawfull hold.</l>
                     <l>Have special care that it not Morgag'd lie,</l>
                     <l>Nor be intailed on Posterity.</l>

                     <l>Then if it stand in Statute, bound or no,</l>
                     <l>Be well advis'd what Quit-rent out must go,</l>
                     <l>What Custome-service hath been done of old</l>
                     <l>By those who formerly the same did hold.</l>
                     <l>And if a wedded woman put to sale,</l>
                     <l>Deal not with her unlesse she bring her Male;</l>
                     <l>For she doth under Covert-barren go,</l>
                     <l>Although sometimes some traffique so (we know.)</l>
                     <l>Thy bargain being made, and all this done,</l>
                     <l>Have speciall care to make thy Charter run,</l>

                  <p>Much might be said to this in point of law; but neither my skill nor time will afford it. It is the best way for every one, not to trust too much to his own
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37680:14"/>skill, but to use the help of some skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Lawyer, and knowing Scrivener. And I shall onely adde this, that though the man you deal withall, have the repute of an honest man: yet trust nor too much upon that; but be carefull to have all the assurance made unto you, as if he were your utter enemy, or a very <hi>K.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the second place, before you can know the true value of the thing to be purchased, you must well consider the nature of the thing, and the casualties that it may be subiect to, and so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goodnesse and certainty thereof, you must cast up the price at a greater or lesser rate of profit.</p>
                  <p>And to this purpose in the first place, take notice that the Rate allowed for Interest money, is the generall ground and rule to estimate the value of any purchase by.</p>
                  <p>This was formerly in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> dayes allowed to be 10 pound for 100. But in King <hi>James</hi>'s time, it was, upon very good grounds brought down
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37680:14"/>to 8 pound for an 100. And now of late, by our present State, it is allowed but to take 6 pound Interest for an 100. Now as the Interest of money falleth, so the price of all kinde of Purchases riseth. This you may see in the following Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. And it must needs be so, because the lesse profit is allowed, the greater principall must be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>pended to bring in the same profit. Thus when money was at 8 in the 100, then 75 pounds would bring in 6 pounds a year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as money being but at 6 in the 100, an 100 pounds will bring in but the said 6 pounds a year.</p>
                  <p>But yet you must not think that this Rate allowed for Interest money, is the absolute rule of all Purchases; but as formerly, when money went at 8 for an hundred, yet Land was worth 18 years purchase: so now money is at 6 for the hundred, Land is well worth 20 years purchase. And though men who thus lay out their money upon Land, have but five in the hundred profit for their money; yet there may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37680:15"/>be good reasons given why men should be willing so to do. As,</p>
                  <p>First, Because though every thing be subiect to casualty in this uncertain World; yet an estate in Land is lesse subiect to danger, and of more sure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, both for a mans own life, and his posterity after him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It hath been hitherto, and it is like to be so still, that the price of money falls cheaper, and the price of Land riseth dearer: and that not only (as I said before) in proportion to the rate of Interest, but in respect of the value of the things themselves; in such wise, that a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me that formerly was worth but 30 pounds a year, is now worth 50 pounds, or more. So that the old Rents of Land, may in a short time be much improved, whereby the Land-Lord may in a short time mend his bargain, if it be any good peny-worth when he bought it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In point of Piety, many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37680:15"/>men had rather lay out their money in Land, though with lesser profit; then let it out to Interest: Because Usury, through the ill practises of many, hath gotten such an odious name, and been so generally condemned by many godly men.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is much equity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For as men who have greater Stocks, and Trade by Whol-sale; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> live upon a lesser rate of profit than those who have but small Stocks, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Trade by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. So men who have great Estates, to buy land therewith; may very well lay out their money at lesse profit then other men, and yet live better thereof. Thus a man that hath 4000 pounds, may purchase therewith 200 pounds a yeare, and may live bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereupon, though he have but five pounds in the 100 profit for his money; then he that hath an estate of 1000 pounds in money, and puts it out to Interest at six pounds for an hundred, can live of 60 pounds the yearely Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thereof. And hereupon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37680:16"/>
                     <hi>Justinian</hi> made a Law that Noble men and Earls should take but 4 pounds Interest for 100. Artificers might take 8 pounds. Merchant Adventurers 12 pounds, and other men 6 pounds in an hundred.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for the price of Land in generall, here in <hi>England</hi> it is worth 20 years purchase. In other Countreys, where money is plenty, and land scarce, it may be worth more; as in <hi>Holland</hi> land is worth 30 years purchase, and money not worth 3 or 4 <hi>per C nt.</hi> But in many other places it is worth lesse. Yea, as I am informed in <hi>Lincoln-shire</hi> very good land is sold for 15 or 16 years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase: these things the buyer and seller must confider of, and do therein, as their own judgement, and their occasions, and opportunities offered, will allow them the best bargain.</p>
                  <p>IN the next place it may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after what Rate Leases of Land are fittest to be let. And that is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the present Rate of Interest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, what ever it be; whether 5, 6, 7, or 8 in the hundred.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:37680:16"/>
                  <p>For first, It is not fit that they should pay more then their money will yield them; because they are men of smaller estates, and such as, for the most part, do with much care, cost and pains, get their Rent for their Land-Lords, who live many times at ease. And if their Land-Lord think they have too good a peny-worth, he wants not power and will to make him pay more for his next Bargain.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, it is not fit that these Leases should be let at any under Rate, both because they are certain, and lesse hazard therein, then in laying out their money any other way: and also, because the Land-Lord himselfe gives a dearer Rate, and so would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be-too much damnified. And after this Rate you must value all other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit'es which are certain, and assured by Lands.</p>

                     </gap> letting and selling of Houses. And herein it will be very
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37680:17"/>requisite to consider of the many Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties which Houses are subject to.</p>
                  <p>As first from the Air, they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually weather-beaten; and sometimes, by extraordinary windes and tempests, much rent and torne; so that in a short time they run to decay, if they be not continually kept in good repair.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from the water likewise they receive continuall damage, even by the ordinary showers of rain, which are subject to soke in and rot, and spoil them, if not carefully prevented: and many times also extraordinary floods and inundations destroyes them in a moment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, though this destruction by water need not much be feared in many places; yet fire may be justly feared in all: which, if it once get the mastery, is a mercilesse enemy; and this it doth too-too often, and is not to be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all our own care and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, proceeding many times from the carelesnesse of a neighbour, or an idle servant.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:37680:17"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Earth it selfe, though it be their best friend, and for the most part upholds them; yet many times for the sins of the inhabitants, it trembles under them, throwes them down, or swallowes them up. By this meanes, whole Cities are sometimes destroyed in an instant: and though this seldome happens in our Island, yet in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> dayes there were three of these Earthquakes; and though, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God, they did no great hurt; yet some they did in this particular.</p>
                  <p>But passing by all these perty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary casualties, there is one more which, in my minde, is more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered then all the rest; and that espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if a man buy an house not for his own use and habitation, but to let it out to others. And that is, that many times a man shall meet with an ill Tenant, that will scarce pay his Rent; and sometimes it may stand empty without a Tenant, and so bring in no profit at all; and also hereby it runs more spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ruine. And this case is so much the more considerable, because it is so ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37680:18"/>and for this very reason, an house that stands void, is not worth so much by at least a years purchase, as another house that hath a good Tenant in it; and it is so much the worse if the house stands not in a good place, where it is like to be long without a Tenant: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever a year is quickly gone, and a year lost at the beginning, is worth as much as two afterward.</p>
                  <p>All these things, though men do what they can to prevent them, and shift them off from themselves by Fines and Leases; yet they must needs fall either upon the Landlord or the Tenant, and many times fall heavy enough upon both.</p>
                  <p>For these and such like reasons, it was the usuall custome, when money was at eight in the hundred, to let Leases of Houses of 21 years, for 7 years purchase. By which reckoning (as you may see by the Tables follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) they allowed about 13 in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for the profit of their money to the buyers. For after 12 in the hundred one pound yearly rent for 21 years, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37680:18"/>worth 7 pounds, 11 shillings 2 pence, which is above 7 years and an halfe purchase, therefore bare 7 years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase yields more profit, and is much about 13 in the hundred.</p>
                  <p>Now if this rate were thought fit when money was at eight in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, then, now money is at six, such Leases may very well be let after the rate of ten in the hundred. And so one pound yearly Rent to continue 21 years is worth 8 pounds, 12 shillings and 11 pence, that is, 8 years, an halfe, and halfe a quarters purchase. And this I suppose to be the fittest rate for most ordinary houses.</p>
                  <p>But yet since some Houses being new and strongly built, need little or no reparations, and others, being old and decayed, need great and costly repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and many times must be partly built, since these things lie commonly upon the Tenant, the better sort of Houses will be worth more, and the other lesse. So that the prizes of all these leases of Houses, may be reckoned after the rates of 8, 9, 10, or 12, <hi>per Centum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37680:19"/>
                  <p>And to conceal nothing from you in this point; the chief thing to be looked upon in this particular, is whether the yearly rent of the house be rated at such an easie rate, that the house is very well worth it, and will yield rather more then lesse. In this case, the house may be worth a years or two years purchase more then otherwise. But if the house be but rated according to its outmost value, it will be a dear peny-worth to give above the rate of 10 <hi>per Centum</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be objected against this, the great cost which men are at in building of Houses, so that if Leases of them yield no better rate, those who are at the cost to build them, will scarce have five or six in the hundred for their money laid out upon them.</p>
                  <p>To this it may be replyed, that Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are things from whence the Tenant, for the most part, receiveth little or no profit, being chiefly sleeping holes to defend them from the injury of the weather; for which purpose many times lesse costly houses would serve the turn.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37680:19"/>And therefore what ever men may lay out upon the building and beautifying of them, for their own pleasure and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, yet it will be the part of every wise builder, to lay out no more thereon, then is fitting and necessary, according to the place it stands in; that so the yearly rent may bring in some considerable profit, at least to the rate of eight in the hundred.</p>
                  <p>As for publique Buildings, either for strength or ornament, they are not to be measured by so private a Standard.</p>
                  <p>If any well affected persons, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, having stocks of money ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by them, shall build in convenient places, or Towns wasted by fire, houses somwhat above the degree aforesaid; such men, though they receive lesse profit, yet they deserve more praise.</p>
                  <p>But as for those that lay out so much upon their private houses, that many times they would be glad to sell them again for half their cost; they may thank themselves for their losse; and may well be accounted foolish Builders,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37680:20"/>that did not consider before hand, what it would cost them.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been said, you may perceive that Leases either of Land or Houses, are the most profitable Tenures for the ordinary sort of men. But yet you may desire to know whether an ordinary Lease of 21 years; or a longer Lease of 40, 50, or 60 years be best.</p>
                  <p>I start this question, to lay open the errour of many men, who proceed in these Bargains without sufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in point of Art. And from hence it is that one concludes that a short Leas is most profitable, which he thinks thus sufficiently proved.</p>
                  <p>Saith he, Suppose a man hath 1000 pounds to bestow upon a Lease, if he will purchase a Lease of 100 years, it will cost 13 years purchase at the least, so your 1000 pounds will buy but 77 pounds a year, which doth not amount to the Use of your money after the rate of eight in the hundred: Whereas, if you will buy a Lease of 21 years, you may have it for seven years purchase,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37680:20"/>(money being at the foresaid rate,) so your 1000 pounds will purchase you a Lease of 140 pounds a year, which is 60 pounds a year more then the Use of your money will come unto. So that in the longer Lease you will lose three pounds a year, and by the shorter Lease you will gain three score pounds a year more then your money will yield at Interest.</p>
                  <p>This reckoning I confesse is true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these erronious rules, by which most men make their bargains: and so for want of better knowledge, often times run themselves into very great dammages. The chiefe cause whereof proceeds from mens setting too low a price &amp; value upon a short Lease, and too high a price and esteem upon a long Lease, which is only for lack of Art, And perhaps men may be deceived herein, reasoning thus with themselves, If a man gives 7 years purchase for a Lease of 21 years, it is 7 years before he receives his principall money again, and then he hath but 14 years more for the increase thereof, and in all the 21
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37680:21"/>years he receives his money laid out but three times over: Whereas, a man gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 13 years purchase for a Lease of 100 years; though it be 13 years before he receive his principall in again, yet then he hath 87 years of clear profit, and in the whole 100 years, receives his money laid out almost eight times over.</p>
                  <p>But this reason deceives men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering too much of the often return of the money, and too little of the length of the time. For he that hath a Lease of 21 years, for seven years purchas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; it is true, he can in that 21 years make but a threefold return of his money: but then after those 21 years, he may make such another bargain for 21 years more, and so return his money three times more. And so continuing to do, in 105 years he may return his principall laid out 15 times over, ten times whereof will be clear gains; whereas the other shall gain little more then halfe so much.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, count which way you will, it is manifest there is a very great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37680:21"/>dis-proportion between the price of the long Lease, and the price of the short Lease; which ought not to be so. For what reason is there but that a man should have as good a peny-worth in a long Lease, as in a short one: And I suppose the intent both of buyer and seller is that it should be so: but all the fault lies in those false Rules and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms; and may all with much right and reason be amended by Art.</p>
                  <p>The truth therefore is, the short Lease is much undervalued; and the long Lease is much over-valued. For in the short Lease, the buyer hath after 13 in the hundred allowed him for the profit of his money; whereas in the long Lease he hath not after 8. And the reason of this over-valuing the long Lease, is either for want of skill, or consideration what the money in that time, at Interest upon Interest will come to. Indeed all men have not time or skill to cast it up, and there is much want of Tables of sufficient length for this purpose, most Tables not exceeding 31 years. And this was the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37680:22"/>of my writing, and therefore I have inlarged my Tables to 100 years apiece: yet not all in single years, because the difference would be but small, in many of the years, and may be supplied well enough by esteemation and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now by these Tables you may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, that however men may esteem of a long Lease, yet in most of these things a Lease of 100 years is worth very little more then a Lease of 60 years; and a Lease of 60 years is not worth much more then a Lease of 31 years.</p>
                  <p>As for example, in the Table of ten in the hundred, the price of one pound to continue one and twenty yeares, is worth 8 pounds, 12 shillings, 11 pence, and the like for 31 years, is worth 9 pouunds, 9 shillings, 7 pence; yet the like to continue 60 years, is worth but 9 pounds, 19 shillings, 4 pence; and for 100 years, is not full 10 pounds.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, this is very strange, and few men think so.</p>
                  <p>I grant it, but the reason hereof is,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37680:22"/>because men do not consider the profit which their money may yield them in so many years. For though it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to take ten in the hundred yearly for money; yet those who have any employment for their money other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, may very well make at least ten in the hundred of it; and after this reckoning, one pound in 60 years will come to 300 pounds, and in 100 years to 13781 pounds; and on the other side, the Reversion of one pound 60 years hence, at this rate, is not worth a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and 100 years hence it is not worth the fourteenth part of a farthing.</p>
                  <p>By this you may see there is great need of Art which like an equall Umpire, between man and man, may declare the true value of any Lease for any time, so that one bargain shall not be too deare, and another too cheap, but each have a due proportion to the time of years; and so in this respect, there is no more advantage or profit in one kinde of Lease more then in another. But he that will not be ruled by Art, but will follow these, or such like, false Rules,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37680:23"/>must (you see of necessity) either wrong himselfe or others, yea, and before he is aware, may wrong himselfe as soon as another, either in buying or selling such bargains.</p>
                  <p>In answer therefore to this question: this false conclusion and unjust practise being taken away, so that a man may have as good a penny-worth in a long Lease as in a shott Lease; it will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, that a long Lease for the most part is the best (at least) for the Tenant. For suppose it be a Lease of Land, the Tenant having a long Lease, may and will strive to improve it what he can, because he is in hopes long to enjoy it, and receive the benefit thereof. And all this will be no great hurt to the Landlord, unlesse he be too greedy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great Fines, or loves alwayes to be raising his Tenants rents, and so many times as they impoverish their Tenants, their Tenants impair their Land.</p>
                  <p>Indeed for Leases of houses the case is more difficult, for they many times cannot well stand out a long Lease; but yet if a man must take such an house
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37680:23"/>that will require new building either in whole or in part, he had better then have a long Lease thereof, that so he may the longer and more certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it after his cost and pains bestowed upon it.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, when a man hath a short Lease either of land or an house, he dares not do what he would to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, lest his Rent should be raised, or he turned out by the greedy covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Landlord, or the envious greedinesse of some evill neighbour.</p>
                  <p>If any one hath an ill bargain of these long Leases, it is the Landlord, and that is not so much because he shall receive so few Fines, but rather by his taking too great Fines of his Tenants, and so by the Fine to cut off so much the more of his yearly Revenue.</p>
                  <p>For you see that for all the money the Landlord receives for the Fines of those Leases, he rebates his Tenant for it, not onely after the rate of simple Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, but at Interest upon Interest, at six, eight or ten in the hundred, which you see increaseth so fast in 50 or 60 years,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37680:24"/>that it eats out almost all the principall Rent, and makes the later half of the years to increase so little in value.</p>
                  <p>It is the best way therefore for Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, in these Leases, not to take over great Fines, but such as may be onely sufficient to binde their Tenants to keep to their bargains, and make them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to perform their covenants, lest they forfeit their Leases, and lose their Fines. And this is the best and most politick end of these manner of Fines. And this will be best for the Tenant, and no hurt to the Landlord.</p>
                  <p>THere is one question more about the buying of houses, and that is, that if such long Leases of them do yield no more, what may be the value of them to buy them out right?</p>
                  <p>To judge the better of this, you must consider the strength and goodnesse of the house, and the Materials of which it is built; whether Timber, Brick, or Stone; In which respects some houses are able to stand many scores (if not some hundreds) of years more then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37680:24"/>others, and when it comes to be pull'd down, these materialls may be worth somewhat, or serve to the new building thereof again. Now he that hath onely a Lease (though it be a long Lease) yet he hath none of this profit, but is bound to be at charge to uphold and maintain it in as good order as it was delivered to him.</p>
                  <p>Again, suppose these things are little worth, yet the very space and quantity of ground whereon the house stands, may in many places be very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, insomuch that it is ordinary for men to build upon a Lease of 31 years, and yet pay a good reasonable Rent to their Landlord besides. Upon these accounts, the purchase of an house out-right, may well be worth two or three years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, more then a Lease of an hundred years. So that though the Leases be not worth above 10 years purchase: yet the Fee-simple of an house may be worth 12 or 13 years purchase.</p>
                  <p>THere is another thing somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in the buying of Land and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37680:25"/>houses, and that is the Taxes which for the present lie heavy upon them. But this I hope by Gods blessing in a short time will be taken off, so that it will be needlesse to give any rules about it. Yet to satisfie men in this, I shall set down this briefly. First, the taxes being known what they come to yearly, may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the outmost yearly value of the Land or house; and so what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, you may safely purchase accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Yet since they may be taken off in good time, I would wish no man to be over-hasty to sell thus; but at least to divide the burthen of these taxes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Customer and himself.</p>
                  <p>THere is another way of purchasing Land or Houses, by buying Lives therein, And this is the ordinary rule for it. One Life in any thing is accounted of equall worth to a Lease of seven years. Two Lives are worth as much as a Lease of 14 years. Three Lives are worth as much as a Lease of 21 years. And so still increasing by seven years for every Life.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:37680:25"/>
                  <p>But this way of reckoning seemes to me somwhat unequall, since one or two may live as long as eight or ten, why should there be so great a difference ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted? I confesse a mans life is very uncertain, and therefore I would wish any to take heed how they deale in such a way of purchasing: but yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the one side, that by this means one is provided for as long as he lives, and when he is dead he need take no care: and on the other side, that if he be any thing young, or likely to live at all, he may live 20 or 30 years, what reason is there that the seller should be at so much hazard, as to venture 30 to 7 for a single Life?</p>
                  <p>Again, though two are better then one, <hi>A threefold Cord is not easily broken,</hi> yet it is not altogether so in mens lives, but many times three or four may die sooner then one, herein the buyer runs some hazard, which though with more reason then the seller before, yet it is sit he should have some consideration for it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in my minde it were more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37680:26"/>equall, if a single life were rated as a Lease of 12 years, or 10 at the least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and so for any more Lives to decrease one year for every Life. And so they will be worth, as in this little Table.

                  <p>Thus much for these pre-considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I shall now set the Tables before you, shewing you the true value of any thing according to these Rules and Rates.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:37680:26"/>
                  <p>But in the first place, I shall set before you the manner of the construction and calculation of these tables, that so I may leave no just exceptions against what I have said, or shall say in this point.</p>
                  <p>The best &amp; most artificial way to make these Tables, is to finde certain numbers in continual proportion decreasing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rate of the Interest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which Numbers may shew the true worth of one pound principal at the end of any number of yeers. And then by addition of all these numbers one to the other, the fore-said Table of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases from year to year is produced, which because they come out all in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimalls</hi> of pounds, you may afterward reduce into pounds, shillings, and pence.</p>
                  <p>Thus let the rate of the Interest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded be 6 in the 100, these numbers will be thus found.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As</hi> 106 <hi>li.: to</hi> 100∷ 1 <hi>li.: to</hi> 0,9434</p>
                  <p>You may increase these fractions as far as you will for the more exactness.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37680:27"/>And thus much is 1 pound worth at the end of one yeer.</p>
                  <p>Then for the second yeer,</p>
                  <p>As 106, to 100; so 9434, to, 8900: which is the worth of one pound at the end of two yeers, so these two added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make 1,8334, which is the worth of one pound Annuity to continue two yeers.</p>
                  <p>So again do for the third yeer.</p>
                  <p>As 106 to 100; so, 8900 to, 8396. which added to the formermakes 2, 6730 which is the value of three yeers.</p>
                  <p>And so you must do for every other yeer, as long as you make your Table for.</p>
                  <p>As you may see by this short Table of 7 yeers at 6 in the hundred.</p>

                  <p>Let it be required to know the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of a Lease of land to continue seven years after he rate of six in the hundred</p>
                  <p>First, take the Logarithme of 100,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37680:30"/>from the Logarithme of 100 and the rate of Interest added together, which in this example is 106.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, multiply this Logarithme by the number of years; which in this example is 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, divide 100 by the rate of the Interest, which is 6, and it will produce 16,6667; then take the Logarithme hereof, and adde it to the former Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithme, the product whereof will yield the Logarithm of the Arerages with the said summe for that time.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, finde out the true number of these Arrerages, and out of them subtract the proportionall part of 100 before found, according to the rate of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; so you shall have the bare Arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages for that proportionall part:</p>
                  <p>Lastly, take the Logarithme of these last Arrerages, and substract from them the Logarithme found by the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the years (in the second rule) so you shall have the Logarithme of the true value of these Arrerages in ready money; the true number whereof being found out and reduced into pounds,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37680:30"/>shillingst and pence, may be used as any number in the Tables.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37680:38"/>of this nature by the yearly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the thing, and use to say, such a thing is worth so many years purchase; this may also plainly and truly be done by the foresaid Tables: and though this way cannot be so exact as the other, yet for custome-sake take it thus.</p>
                           <p>The Tables are exactly cast up for one pound yearly revenue, at each of the said rates, so that in the summes set down therein, for every pound or 20 shillings you must reckon one years purchase; for ten shillings, half a years purchase, for five shillings, a quarter of a years purchase; and so for any summe under, proportionally.</p>
                           <p>Thus in the former example, you found that one pound, to continue 21 years, was worth 11 pound, 15 shillings, 3 pence, that is, 11 years purchase, and about three quarters of a years purchase, after which manner reckoning the ten pound yearly revenue. So,

                           <p>Which is somewhat less then the former; because this way you cannot (as I said) reckon so exactly without some more trouble: for the Table shews you 11 pound, 15 shillings, 3 pence; and this way it is reckoned, as if it were but 11 pound, 15 shillings.</p>
                           <p>Though either of these wayes be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act enough for most men, and most que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of this nature; yet if any desire to be more exact, they will finde some trouble, when either the Annuity or the numbers in these Tables do not make even pounds, or at least common and known parts of a pound. In this case therefore if you will be curious to know the precise value, you must have recourse to the Table of Decimall Fractions, <hi>page</hi> 33. and thereby reduce both the price of the Annuity, and the price of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37680:39"/>the purchase thereof set down in these Tables, into those fractions; and so multiplying one by the other, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the product thereof again by the said Decimall Table, you shall have the true value of the purchase exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                           <p>Thus, let the Annuity be worth 55 pound, 12 shillings, 6 pence, and you desire to know the value thereof for 21 yeares after the rate of six <hi>per Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>

                           <p>Then from this line account four fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures more in the product, (according to the places of the decimall Table) and there make a prick at 4; so the product appears to be 654 <hi>li.</hi> 2890. that is, 654

                           <head>II. <hi>There is another very necessary question easily resolved by these Tables, and that is, When any one doth ask of you such a summe of money, or so many yeers purchase for a parcel of land, lease, or house, to know what profit be allowes you for your money.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>As now, Suppose you may have a lease of an house for 21 years, for eight years and an halfe purchase, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will your money yield you?</p>
                           <p>For this purpose; first, you must finde the number of years in the sides of the Tables, and look in the severall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles untill you finde the said summe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or the neerest you can finde to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37680:40"/>it, then at the head of that Table, you shall finde the rate of the profit which your money brings you in.</p>
                           <p>Thus, if according to this example, you look over all the Tables, for eight yeers and an halfe purchase, that is 8 pounds, 10 shillings in the line of 21 years, you shall finde in the Table of 10 <hi>per Centum,</hi> at 21 years, 8 pounds, 12 shillings, 11 pence, which is the neerest summe that is to be found in all the Tables; and at the head of this Table you shall finde, your money brings you in by this bargain 10 in the hundred profit,</p>

                           </head>
                           <p>Thus, if a Tenant would have 5, 10, or 20 pounds abated in his yearly Rent, it may be reckoned worth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37680:41"/>years purchase as the Tables shew for.</p>
                           <p>But now suppose a Landlord demand an 100 pound fine for the Lease of an house for 21 years, besides the yearly Rent. I would know how much year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rent this 100 pound doth counter-value after the rate of 10 in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                           <p>In this case, you must take the summe set down in the Table, which for this example is 8 pounds, 12 shillings, 11 pence, and finde how many times it is conteined in an 100 pound; for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pounds of yearly Rent it counter-values.</p>
                           <p>Now this you may do by reducing the said 8 pound, 12 shillings, 11 pence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pence; so it 2075 pence. Likwise in an 100 pound are 24000; this divided by the foresaid 2075, yields 11 in the quotient, and there remains 1175/2075, which is somewhat more then an half; so that it is above 11 pound, 10 shillings.</p>
                           <p>If you will know this more exactly, multiply 1175 parts of a pound by 20, so you have 23500, which divided by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37680:41"/>the former number 2075, yields 11 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in the quotient, and 675 remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>Again, if you multiply this 675 by 12, it yields 8100, which divided by 2075, yields almost 4 pence, wanting onely halfe a farthing.</p>
                           <p>So that this 100 pound fine should countervalue according to this rate, 11 pound, 11 shillings 4 pence <hi>ferè</hi> of year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rent.</p>
                           <p>Or you may have recourse to the Table of Reduction following, and thereby reduce the summe into tenths of pounds.</p>
                           <p>Thus the said 8 pounds, 12 shillings, 11 pence reduced, is 8 pound, 6458; with this divide the price of your Fine, an 100 pound, adding some cyphers thereto, as need shall be. So in this example, the Fine being 100 pound, you shall finde 11 pound 566, that is, 11 pounds, 11 shillings, 4 pence <hi>ferè;</hi> and so much yearly Rent doth an 100 pound Fine countervalue at the rate of ten pound in the hundred for 21 yeares.</p>

                           <p>Lastly, you may see by the latter end of the Tables, what rate of profit your money yields you, buying any thing out right at any number of years purchase. Thus, at ten years purchase, your money yields you 10 <hi>per Centum</hi> profit, as you may see by that Table. At 12 years and an half purchase for the free simple, your money yields you 8 <hi>per Centum</hi> profit, as you may see by the end of the Table of 8 <hi>per Centum.</hi> And at 20 years purchase your money yields you but 5 <hi>per Centum</hi> profit.</p>
                           <p>And if you would know this more exactly, take this Rule, Divide an 100 by the number of years, the quotient will shew you the rate of the profit you have for your money.</p>

                              </gap> 100 divided by 12 years, the price of the purchase of the free simple, yields, 8, 3333, or 8 pound, 6 shillings, 8 pence for the rate of the profit.</p>
                           <p>So 100 divided by 18 years, yields 5, 5555, which is 5 pound, 11 shillings, 11 pence for the rate of your profit.</p>
                           <p>Or else if you divide an 100 by the rate of the profit you look to have, in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37680:42"/>the buying of your purchase, you may see how many years purchase you may fully give for it.</p>
                           <p>Thus, Divide an 100 by 6, if that be the rate of the profit you desire in your purchase, and you shall finde 16 years and two thirds of a year, so many years purchase you may give, and yet make 6 in the hundred profit of your money.</p>
                           <p>By this a man having bought Land or Houses at any price, he may know which of the foresaid Tables he must use in the letting Leases thereof again, that he save or get by the bargain, as he shall think fit; or at least may know whether he gets or loses by the Leases he lets.</p>

                     <p>There are other kinde of purchases in Reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the thing yields no profit for the present, till some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable term of years be passed.</p>
                     <p>And in these bargains you must also look first into the quality of the thing, and the certainty thereof; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly seek out the value thereof at a greater or lesser rate of Interest.</p>
                     <p>And to this purpose there might be the Tables set down, shewing the true value of one pound in Reversion after any number of years. But I suppose this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37680:43"/>needlesse, because it is included in the former Tables, and may easily be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of them: for if you begin at the head of any of those Tables, and substract the first line from the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; and the second from the third, &amp;c. to the end of 31, you shall make a true Table of Reversion, shewing the worth of one pound for any year to come.</p>
                     <p>But you may also know what the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of one pound will come to at any time to come without this trouble. For if you take the summe set down in the Tables, against the years of Reversion desired, and subtract the summe next above it, from it, the difference will shew you the true value of 20 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings so many yeares to come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                     <p>Thus if you would know, what 20 shillings is worth 21 years hence, after the rate of money now, which is six in the hundred.</p>
                     <p>Here the years of Reversion being 21, and the rate of the Interest f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37680:44"/>against 21 years; 11 pounds, 15 shillings 3 pence, and in the line above it, 11 pounds, 9 shillings, 5 pence, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of the former, there remains 5 shillings, 10 pence, which is the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of 20 sh. 21 years hence.</p>
                     <p>And thus you may do at any other rate, &amp; for any number of years to 31, by the former part of the Tables. But becaus the latter end of the Table proceeding by ten years will not do the like; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have made this little Table, which in a generall way, shewes both the increase and decrease of twenty shillings principall, after any number of years.</p>

                           <head>The Use of this Table is thus.</head>
                           <p>FIrst, finde out your rate of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest at the head of the Table; then look down in that column till you finde out the number of years desired; and then against this number of years, in that same line, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the left hand, you have the increase of 20 shillings, and upon the right hand the decrease or worth of the Reversion of the said 20 shillings for the number of years desired.</p>
                           <p>Thus in the middle column of the Table, which is cast up at the rate of 8 <hi>per Centum,</hi> you shall finde that in 27 years one pound or 20 shillings will increase to 8 pound, and the Reversion of one pound is worth but 2 shillings, 6
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37680:45"/>pence, at the said time of 27 yeares hence</p>
                           <p rend="indent">Note, If you cannot finde the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years exactly, you may guesse at it by proportion.</p>
                           <p>Also, take notice, this general Table is not so exact as a particular Table hereof is, or ought to be, but yet will serve for the use I shall make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                           <p>And having either of these wayes found the value of one pound, you may by addition, finde the value of ten or twenty pounds or any other summe for the like time; which substracted out of the full worth of the thing, will give you the price of the Reversion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                           <p>Yet because this way is somewhat troublesome, and may much deceive you in regard of the different value of Land, Money and Leases, I suppose this following to be the plainer and the better way.</p>
                           <div n="1" type="section">

                              <head>I. <hi>If you are to purchase the Reversion of a piece of Land.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>First, consider how many years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the Land is worth, if it were presently to be possessed, which is about 20 years purchase, for which account 20 pound.</p>
                              <p>Then look in the Table under the rate of six in the hundred, (which is the rate fittest for Leases of Land) how much the years, for which it is engaged, comes to.</p>
                              <p>Now substract this out of the other, and the remaining summe will give you the value of the purchase, accounting the pounds for years, and the shillings and pence for parts of a year.</p>
                              <p>Thus for example, any piece of Land being worth 20 years purchase, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by Lease, or otherwise, for 21 years, the Reversion will be worth eight years and a quarters purchase.</p>

                              <p>And so much is it worth to have his Lease altered, <hi>viz.</hi> 4 years, and almost half a years purchase.</p>
                              <p>Many other Rules and Tables con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Annuities might be propounded, but these I think of most frequent use and necessary consequence, which thus you see may be all performed by this one sort of Tables.</p>
                              <p>BUt now since none of these bargains can be made without respect had to these or such like Tables of Interest, or Usury, wherein there must respect be had, not onely to simple Use, but to Use
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37680:50"/>upon use; I hope I may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any speak a word or two in the defence of Usury.</p>
                              <p>The Argument I shall use is onely this; That if it be not onely lawfull but necessary to give and take Use upon Use; then, at least, it may be lawfull, though not necessary, to give or take moderate simple Use, according to the allowance of the times.</p>
                              <p>That it is not onely lawfull but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to take or give Use upon Use, is plainly manifest in all these kinde of bargains, which cannot be made any other way. Now the necessity of these bargains is manifest every day, and the lawfulnesse of them cannot be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being so plainly allowed in the Word of God.</p>
                              <p>As for the purchasing of Land and Houses, this is plain, there are many instances of it: And it was a good law, which it were well, if it were still in force; That a mans Lands, either while he were living, or presently after his death, was to be exposed to sale for the payment of his debts. Indeed the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37680:50"/>rules observed for the valuation of these purchases are not so plain. We read that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid 400 shekels of silver, for a field to bury his wife in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. which seemes to be a great price in those dayes. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the 32 Chap. of his Book paid but 7 shekels and 10 pieces of silver for the field he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                              <p>The plainest law for these purchases is that in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.14, 15, 16. <hi>If thou sell, &amp;c. According to the number of years after the</hi> subile <hi>thou shalt buy of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, &amp;c. According to the multitude of years, thou shalt increase the price thereof; and according to the so wnesse of years thou shalt diminish the price of it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>So that they could purchase but (as it were) Leases of Lond from <hi>Jubile</hi> to <hi>Jubile,</hi> which could be but 49 yeers at most; but how they ordered the price, according to the number of those years, it doth not appear.</p>
                              <p>I will not binde any to my conceit hereof, but when I was calculating the Table of 12 <hi>per Centum,</hi> perceiving it to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37680:51"/>come up very neor to the highest price about 50 years, I presently thought tha<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>
                                 </gap> by some such rule and rate of Intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap> they might very fitly reckon the price of these purchases: for so by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the longest Leases could be little better worth then a Lease of 50 years, which was the period of the <hi>Jubile.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>If any think this was too great a ra<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap> of Interest for them to take of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: let them consider, that the Iewes ever were, and yet are very greedy of taking great Interest, <hi>viz.</hi> of 20 or 30 <hi>per Centum.</hi> For otherwise <hi>Nehemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                                       <desc>••</desc>

                                 </hi> did very little ease the people, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the rich to release onely the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of that which they did exact from their poor brethren, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.13. which the Margine of our Bibles shew to be meant of the loane for the money, which if it were but at 5 or 10 <hi>per Centu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </hi> would be but a shilling or two in an hundred pounds.</p>
                              <p>But however, the rate of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase was, this is plain, that there was a consideration to be had to the number of the years, and that the price was to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37680:51"/>be thereafter: So that there was a kinde of implicite Interest used in these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases.</p>
                              <p>But you will say, these bargains can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come within the compasse of Usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because the buyer herein stands to all hazards.</p>
                              <p>I answer, that either his hazard is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little, or for all hazards he is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a sufficient recompence; so that for the most part he is upon a surer way of gain then the other; and his gain in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall things is so much overplus, that a man may with good profit take up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at Interest to buy the bargains.</p>
                              <p>Indeed this point of <hi>hazard</hi> is much controverted in this case, some counting is unlawfull to contract for gain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they also contract for losse; as in partnership. And this they ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.14, 15. <hi>If a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make it good. But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37680:52"/>hired thing, it came for the hire.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>But this Text speaks little to that purpose, the substance of this law being still in force, and thus to be understood: If a man hire an horse or such like to go a journey, or plough, or such like; and the horse by some sall or other accident die, or be hurt therein, having no ill usage by the borrower, then the Londer can recover no recompence, but onely the hire of his horse, as was agreed upon between them. But if the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er misuse this beast, then he is liable to pay for it.</p>
                              <p>As for that phrase <hi>(the owner being by, or not being by)</hi> it may very well be understood of any other person, who is an indifferent witnesse between the two parties, to give testimony of the well or ill usage of the beast.</p>
                              <p>But though this be just, equall and usuall in things of this nature, yet it is not so in other things, which are more certain and not subject to such casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. No man will sell an hundred pounds worth of any commodities, to be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37680:52"/>paid a twelve moneth hence for it, upon condition that the buyer makes a good market thereof, and gets by the bargain: but will look for his money agreed for, at the due time; and ought to have it, though the buye lose by the bargain. And though lending of money in this way is not altogether the same case, yet it is very like. Why may not he which lends an hundred pounds for a year be said to sell this hundred pounds worth of silver or gold, to be paid an hundred and six pounds of good money for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the years end? and why then may not he as justly demand his price agreed on at the due time, though the other have not made so good profit of it as he expected? as the other Creditour may demand his price agreed upon of his Debtor, though he have not made so good profit of it as he expected?</p>
                              <p>And to make this appear yet more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, consider that money is such a commodity that cannot of it self be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, as most other things will, so that it is the borrowers own fault, (for the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37680:53"/>most part) if there be any great losse; and therefore the Lender ought to be free from any damage by the foresaid law, and the borrower is to bear all the losse; for <hi>the owner not being by, the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower is to make the thing borrowed good.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And yet for all this, as it is fit that in some cafes, where there are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry losses befall men, by the hand of God; the Creditour ought both in humanity and Christianity to have pity and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience toward his poor Debtor. So I hope there is no such Lenders of money, but will in the like cases be as forward as others, to approve themselves good and mercifull men. Otherwise, the best defence can be made for this course will not avail them, when God shall call them to an account, as he did that wicked servant for casting his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant into prison.</p>
                              <p>But for this conditionall contract for losse and gain, it is good for nothing But to embroll men in suits of law; or to incourage and impower ill minded men to cozen others of their estates.</p>
                              <pb n="81" facs="tcp:37680:53"/>
                              <p>But you will say, this kinde of Usury hath not onely been condemned by the most part of the best of men, but by God himselfe is expresly forbidden, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curses and blessings pronounced by him in his Word to the keepers and breakers of this very law.</p>
                              <p>If this be so, the matter is not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, but upon survey of the sacred Statutes, I cannot finde them so strict and severe in this particular.</p>
                              <p>The chief law declared by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against Usury, is that in the 23 of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> verse 19. <hi>Thou shalt not lend upon Ʋsury to thy brother, Ʋsury of money, Ʋsury of victuals, Ʋsury of any thing that is lent upon Ʋsury.</hi> Upon the breaking and keeping this law depends all the other promises and threats in the Scripture: therefore this place being cleered, all other Scriptures relating hereunto, will also be answered.</p>
                              <p>Now this at the first view seemes to be a generall law, forbidding all kinde of Usury. But I answer first, the outmost extent of this law, is that one Israelite might not lend upon Usury to another
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37680:54"/>Israelite. For in the very next verse they are permitted to lend upon Usury unto strangers, <hi>verse</hi> 20. <hi>Ʋnto a stranger thou mayest lend upon Ʋsury, but unto thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou mayest not lend upon Ʋsury.</hi> And I see no reason to understand by these strangers such whom they might oppress and destroy, as some would interpret it; since God gave them so many Items and Commands to be kinde to strangers. And how dear it cost the Family of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the whole Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> to do otherwise, you may read in the 2 Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 21 Chap.</p>
                              <p>Again secondly, this generall law of Usury to their brethren seemes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streined to their poor brethren in the 25 of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> 35, 36, 37 verses, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. so that it chiefly and principally, if not wholly and absolutely, belongs to them.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, I see no reason, why this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick law belonging to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fitted to their condition, place, and times, should take so fast hold of us, as some would make it, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the many other laws of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37680:54"/>which are not pressed upon us by these men. As their buying of Lands, which were all to return to the old poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. And that law of freedome from debts every seventh year, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4. which is parallel to this of Usury in all respects. For first, it is laid down gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in <hi>verse</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Every Creditour that lendeth ought unto his neighbour, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease it in the seventh year.</hi> Secondly, Notwithstanding this, it is permitted to demand it of strangers in the 3 Verse. Thirdly, it is permitted to take it of the rich brother in the 4 Verse, <hi>Save when there shall be no poor among you.</hi> So that the force of these Lawes, and the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, is to keep them and us onely from oppression of the poor. And from hence our law may be derived, that a Book-debt, without bill or bond, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be recovered after seven years. Yet I hope no man will say, that in point of equity and conscience he is discha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>ed from the payment thereof, if he hath wherewith to pay it; neither that his Creditour doth offend either against
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37680:55"/>Gods law or mans, in requiring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him.</p>
                              <p>Fourthly, that this law against Usury was onely fitted to the state of the <hi>Jews,</hi> may be plain from the things forbidden to take Usury upon, which was victuals, and other things as well as money. So that there being few Merchants and Trades-men amongst them, Usury of money was very little necessary; and as for Usury of other things, it tended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the oppression of the poor. Who would not spit in that mans face, and count him not worthy to live, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corn lying in store by him, would not lend his neighbour a bushell or two till his Harvest was reaped, a moneth or two after, without half a bushell for the use thereof? In such cases of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon want and scarcity; it is not onely the duty of private men in charity to lend (if not give) to their poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but the publick Magistrate ought to look to it, that there be no such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men as hoard and hide their corn: nay, more then this, in case of extream want and famine, it may be lawfull and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37680:55"/>laudable for them to take the stores of corn into their own hands, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them to every one, as need shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                              <p>And this was the reason that Usury was forbidden by many other States: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> not because it was against the light of nature, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rules of policy. And though <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, it is a monstruous thing for money to beget money, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Money answereth all things,</hi> Eccl. 10 19. and is the fittest thing of all others to be employed in Merchandize, and put out to Use.</p>
                              <p>In these times and places therefore, wherein there are many have so great stocks of money, which they have no way to employ; and others have wayes to employ money to profit, but want it; there may very well and fitly be a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and reciprocal advantage to both, by a moderate Interest upon money; which I hope I have plainly shewed to be allowed by the Lawes of God, and is permitted by the lawes of the most ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and well-ordered Countreys.</p>
                              <pb n="86" facs="tcp:37680:56"/>
                              <p>Yet I would have no man hereby har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den his heart against his poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and withhold his hand from lending freely to him: nor to repine at the low rate of Interest allotted by the State; much lesse to sooth up himself in oppression or extortion. Let such know, though Usury be lawfull, yet it is scarce laudable. And if any by their unjust courses herein exceed the lawfull bounds, they deserve to finde no favour with men, however God deals with them.</p>
                              <p>In this case therefore I would have all men to take example by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. <hi>All things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, but all things are not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi> This way may be <hi>expedient</hi> for some, which is not so for others. Our Saviour in the 21th. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the parable of the Talents, seems to allow the idle servant rather to have put his Talent out to others to Usury, then to let it lie hid in the earth; (though they deserved most commendation that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and gain'd therewith themselves.) So then for young Orphans, Widows,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37680:56"/>and old people, who cannot so well deal in the world for themselves, this way is not onely <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>expedient.</hi> And for such it is that I plead, who cannot so well speak for themselves: As for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who out of an idle and covetous minde, would by this meanes live in the world like Drones in the hive, upon the sweat of others browes; I suppose they are scarce able to answer sufficiently for the defence of themselves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would wish them to take some other course.</p>
                              <p>And to this purpose there is one step higher, which they that will attain to persection must endeavour after. Some things you see are <hi>lawful,</hi> some things are <hi>expedient,</hi> but some things are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi> And these things we ought chiefly to follow. It may be <hi>lawful</hi> for all, and it may be <hi>expedient</hi> for some to lend upon Usury; but it is <hi>excellent</hi> for all to lend without Usury, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to the poor. There are three sorts of men, upon whom we may lay out our money upon a different account. To the <hi>rich</hi> we may lend upon Usury, for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37680:57"/>our <hi>own sake:</hi> to our <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> we ought to lend freely, for <hi>their sakes:</hi> to the <hi>poor</hi> we ought to give freely, for <hi>Gods sake.</hi> He that with an holy wisedome thus shares out his estate, to these three sorts of persons, deserves not the black brand of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, but shall receive praise and profit both of God and men.</p>
                              <p>But the cries of the poor, will be very loud against those men, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the lawes of God and men to the contrary, do use such extortion and oppression to the poorer sort of people, as to make them pay not onely 6, 8, or 10, but 20, 30, or 40 in the hundred in greater summes, and much more in lesser.</p>
                              <p>It hath been accounted a favourable extortion among them, to lend twenty shillings upon a very sufficient pawn for six pence for one moneth of 28 dayes, and six pence or eight pence for their Bill or Bond; and so they make 13 shillings of their 20 in a year, which is, 65 pound of an hundred.</p>
                              <pb n="89" facs="tcp:37680:57"/>
                              <p>Others lend out to the poorest sort of people twelve pence for a moneth, for one peny profit; and this, though it seem but little to some, yet by this means they may gain 13 pence with their shilling in a year, which comes to an 108 pounds, 6 shillings, 8 pence, for an hundred.</p>
                              <p>Nay, some have been so unconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to take a peny a week for the use of twelve pence; and so for the 52 weeks in the year, it comes to 4 shillings, 4 pence, which is 433 pound, 6 shillings, 8 pence for an hundred.</p>
                              <p>But others are more cautious of comming thus within the danger of the Statute, and let their money out at the lawful rate, onely the Bill-money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth their profit.</p>
                              <p>Again, others sell commodities to men at unreasonable rates, and then some of their partners buy it again for 20 or 30 in the hundred lesse; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing surely bound to pay the full price, and all their fees, and under-hand bribes beside.</p>
                              <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37680:58"/>
                              <p>Such men as these are justly odious, and may expect, that all the curses, and reproaches against this sin, will fully and speedily sall upon them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God give them grace to repent of it, and in some good sort to make resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
                              <p>To remedie this evill, it hath been the custome of some Cities beyond the Sea, (and the endeavours of some honest men to effect the like in this) to have publick bankes of money for charitable uses, out of which the poor might at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time upon a sufficient pawn, borrow any small summe of money, and yet pay very little for Interest or charges; but onely so much as needs must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed towards the mainteining of some few Officers to dispose thereof.</p>
                              <p>Ten or twenty thousand pound in such a banke, might be a great relief to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or fourty thousand poor folkes within the com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>se of a year; yea though they paid after the rate of five or six in the hundred. And so they who laid in the moneys into the banke, might
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37680:58"/>receive 4 or 5 of it, and the rest go to the Officers for writing the bils, and delivering out the money and goods, which would be a great help to the poor, who are now forced to pay to their brokers after the rate of 30 or 40 pounds in the hundred; and little or no hinderance to those well-minded persons, who should put in money to be thus employed, since they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive within twenty or fourty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a year as much as their money will yield them in the purchase of Land, or letting it out to Interest to others.</p>
                              <p>But I fear in these unsetled and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome times this will hardly be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and which is worse, much money that hath been given to Halls and publique places for the benefit of poor men and young beginners, is now lost or spent, or converted to other uses, which is an high offence against God, an injury both to the dead and to the living, and an ignominy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                              <p>And therefore, that men may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37680:59"/> take heed to themselves, both in giving and taking of the lawfull Interest, I have here added this Table of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest after the rate of six in the hundred, being the rate appointed by the State for these present times.</p>

                           <p>Thus the Interest of 146 pounds for six moneths will be found thus.</p>

                           <p>Which is 4 pounds, 7 shillings, 7 pence, and 20 hundred parts of a peny, that is, almost a farthing, as I noted before.</p>
                           <p>And thus you may do for any other summe of money, and for the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnesse, I have set down the Interest-money, not onely in moneths, but in single dayes to a moneth. Now a moneth in these Tables is supposed to be just the twelf part of a year, but yet it is ordinarily reckoned by the usuall moneths of the year, <hi>Ianuary, February, March, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But this way of reckoning by Moneths is not altogether so exact as it might be wished; for some Moneths have but 30 dayes, and others 31, and <hi>February</hi>
                              <pb n="107" facs="tcp:37680:66"/>hath commonly but 28. And therefore it may be worth the while (especially in great sums) to look more curiously into the time, and count it by dayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> for otherwise there may be wrong done either to the lender or borrower una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
                           <p>For instance, suppose a bond made the 10th. of <hi>February</hi> for six moneths, or half a year, the ordinary time. If you reckon by moneths, it will be due the 10th. of <hi>August:</hi> but since there are 365 dayes in a year, the half thereof is 182 dayes and an half, but you cannot reckon lesse then 183 dayes; and if you account these 183 dayes from the 10th. of <hi>February,</hi> they will reach to the 12th. of <hi>August.</hi> So that by reckoning the time by the moneths, the borrower will pay the money two dayes too soon. Now if the sum of money be but 1000 pound, the Interest for those two dayes will be 6 shillings, 7 pence (very neer) and so much wrong the borrower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and the Statute (perhaps) is broken hereby,</p>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:37680:67"/>
                           <p>To remedy this; I have observed, that Scriveners usually make such Bonds, to be paid alwayes two dayes after the day whereon the Bond is dated.</p>

For, suppose a Bond be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 10th. of <hi>August,</hi> they (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this rule) make it to be paid the 12 of <hi>February;</hi> whereas accounting 183 dayes (as they ought to do) for the half year, the Bond will be <hi>(justly)</hi> due upon the 9th. of <hi>February:</hi> and so by this means the Lender loseth three dayes Interest.</p>
                           <p>Again, if a Bond be made the 10th. of <hi>February</hi> to be paid the 12 of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust;</hi> although in this (by chance) there is no wrong to either party: yet if a new Bond be made this 12 of <hi>August,</hi> to be paid the 14 of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> the Lender you see in the whole year loseth four dayes, which is very considerable in great sums of money, or when Bonds are often renued.</p>
                           <p>To avoid these inconveniences, I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37680:67"/>have made this following Table; by which you shall know both the exact time of any part of a year in dayes; and also the Interest which is due for any time or number of dayes.

                           <p>THe Tables are so plaine, that I suppose they need no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, being made in the form of a plain Almanack. Onely I shall shew the use thereof in two or three examples.</p>
                           <div n="1" type="section">
                              <head>I. <hi>If a bond be dated the</hi> 10th. <hi>of February, when is the half year, or</hi> 183 <hi>days out?</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>First, in these tables you shall find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the 10th. of February, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 41, which shews, it is the one and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day from the beginning of the year; and then if you add 183 dayes being the half year to this 41, it makes 224 dayes. Then look forward till you finde this number, which you shall find in this table
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37680:70"/>against the 12th. of August; and this is the day when the half yeer is finished.</p>

                              <p>In this you must substract the later time out of the, former time. Thus, against the last of December, you shall finde 365 days, and against the 10th. of August 222 days, which substracted out of the other, there remaines 143, and so many are the dayes required.</p>
                              <p>But because many times it will be needfull to know the days which fall out in severall years, and so the number, out of which you should substract, will be lesser then the number which you should substract out of it: in thit case you may first finde the days to that years end, and then add the lesser number which fall out in the year following thereunto.</p>

                              <p>The like you may do for any other number of dayes, or any other time of a year, only take notice that the year consisting of 365 dayes, the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of exactly are thus:

And observe how many figures you multiply by, and cut off so many figures from the end of the product, the rest of the figures; if they be three, put one cipher before them; if they be two, put two cyphers before them, to make them agree to the 4 places in the Table and seek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>So the whole Interest appears to be 16 pound, 12 shillings, 5 pence.</p>
                              <p>But, me thinks, I hear some taxing of me for being so scrupelous in account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Interest of money by dayes, and not rather teach some way, how a just abatement should be made for those payments which are made before the year is fully out. For the Act allowes to take 6 pound in the hundred for the whole yeare; now if a man takes 3 pound <hi>per Centum</hi> for the half year; the said 3 pound in the other half year will yield, at the same rate, 1 shilling, 9 pence, 2 farthings; and thus, some think, a man takes more then the Act allowes, and comes within the danger thereof.</p>
                              <p>But the Law herein looks upon the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37680:75"/>year as the fittest measure of time to proportion the Interest by; and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the law is to restrain the grosser abuses of Extortioners, and not to take notice of such niceties a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> this; which would have made it either very large and tedious, by appointing exact Tables for it, moneth by moneth, nay day by day; or else intricate, and full of snares for men to fall into. The plain meaning of the law is this; that, as a year should measure the time, so the said 6 pound should proportion the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; the parts of the one answering to the parts of the other; neither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing any Interest upon the Interest, for the time under or over a year, nor tying any man to let or take up money for the whole year.</p>
                              <p>And the usuall custome therefore in this case is a good Comment upon this Law; by which most Bonds of this nature are made to be paid at six moneths end, and yet the full half of the whole years Interest allowed; which would never have been so long and frequently done, if it had been
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37680:75"/>thought any breach of the Statute.</p>
                              <p>And therefore, though there might be an allowance made by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement, and the cause may seem somewhat like, yet it is not the same; neither doth the strictest rebatement used among Merchants, take any notice thereof, but is grounded upon another cause, as you may see more in the next particulars.</p>

                     <p>Now this rebatement hath been usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reckoned by the Tables ordinary Interest, abating so much out of the principall debt, as the use of the said principall would come to in the time agreed upon. But in reckoning thus, there will alwayes be some dammage to the Creditour who doth abate, which though in little summes, will not be much, yet in greater summes of money, such as this rebatement is most used in, it will be very considerable, and is of late used by the most skilfull Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>

                        </gap> shilling, 9 pence. So that there is onely 2 pound, 18 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, 3 pence to be abated, and not 3 pound, as by the other reckoning.</p>
                     <p>Therefore if you would finde out the worth of any debt, duc hereafter in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy money; First, finde out by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Interest, what an hundred pound will yield in the time desired: then work by the rule of proportion thus,

                        <list>

                              <hi>As an</hi> 100 <hi>pound, with the Interest thereof for that time,</hi>

                              <hi>To its worth in ready money.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, to finde the worth of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound, due 12 moneths hence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> 106, <hi>to</hi> 100; <hi>so</hi> 100, <hi>to</hi> 94.3396.</p>
                     <p>Which is 94 pound, 6 shillings, 9 pence, 2 farthings. So that here is not six pounds to be abated out of the 100 pound, (as some have thought) but 5 pound, 13 shillings, 2 pence, 2 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. And thus the cred tour may save 6 shillings, 9 pence, 2 saithings, which by the other way of reconing he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in his own wrong. And if the sum be greater, or the time of payment long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his damage will be more.</p>
                     <p>Again, you see that this money to be rebated doth not increase equally, in an equall time; there was 2 pound, 18 shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngs, 3 pence, to be abated out of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37680:78"/>100 pound, due at 6 Moneths, but there is but 5 pound, 13 shillings, 2 pence, 2 far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things to be abated for the 100 pounds due at 12 Moneths; which is not the double of the other, for so it should have been, 5 pound, 16 shillings, 6 pence. So that these Tables must be cast up for every Moneth at the least, which is the most usuall way of reckoning the times of payments among Merchants, and thus I have drawn them out to 24 Moneths, which is as long (I think) as any Merrchant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to trust.</p>

                              <p>And this product divided by the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debt 1500 pound, the quotient will shey 12 moneths for the time of payment.</p>
                              <pb n="144" facs="tcp:37680:85"/>
                              <p>This rule is not much out of the way; yet somewhat it sails, as will appear by comparing it with the former. For if the said 1500 pound be to be paid all at 12 moneths, then the worth of it in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy money will appear to be but 1415 pound, 1 shilling, 10 pence, 2 farthings, whereas the true value of the debt in ready money was before found to be 1415 pound, 17 shillings, one farthing; by this means therefore the Creditour will lose 15 shillings, one peny, three farthings more then he ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
                              <p>Yet this way of reducing of payments comes so neer the exact truth, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prescribe a better way in generall, to finde it out. But if any will be so punctual, and think it worth their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, let them try one by the other, and so finding the difference, which here is 15 shillings; finde out by the Tables of Interest, in how many dayes the 1500 pound will require 15 shillings Interest; and you shall finde the neerest time is 3 dayes. For the Interest of 1500 pound so three dayes is 14 shillings, 9 pence:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37680:85"/>these three dayes therefore being taken from the 12 Moneths aforesaid, shewes the true time due for the payment of the whole 1500 pound.</p>
                           </div>
                           <div n="4" type="section">

                              <p>If any will be so strict in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements, as to look after any time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a moneth; they may, by the former Tables of Interest, finde out the Interest of their principall debt for the odde dayes, and adde that to the Rebate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the moneths, without much errour.</p>
                              <p>But if they will be more exact, let them, by the Tables of daily Interest, finde out the Interest of 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Thus, if you would know the rebate out of an hundred pound for 190 dayes.</p>
                              <p>The Interest for 190 dayes is 3 pound, 1200 parts. Therefore, <hi>As</hi> 103. 1200, <hi>li. to</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>And thus much for these Tables of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. All that I have said hitherto hath been about Interest either simple or compound, by which you may see the good use which may be made thereof, and how the abuse may be avoided and prevented.</p>
                              <p>And here I thought to have put as end to this little Book. But since there are many other things of a generall concernment, and not impertinent to the former Discourse, I shall adde somewhat concerning a few of them, as briefly as I can.</p>

                  <p>Twelve inches make one foot.</p>
                  <p>Three foot make one yard; which is common English measure, wherewith most English commodities are measured. As for the El, though it be commonly used among us, yet the Statute takes little or no notice of it, it being a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign measure, and used about forreign commodities, as Silks, and French Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens. The length of the El is five quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our yard; so that five yards are four Els.</p>
                  <p>These are the measures, by which all
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:37680:89"/>small quantities are measured; but for measuring of Land they make use of Poles or Rods.</p>

                  <p>So that in a measured Mile, there are 320 Poles, or 1760 yards, or 5280 feet, or 63360 inches, or 190080 barly-corns. But the miles commonly accounted from one place to another are more, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse within 20 miles round off <hi>London.</hi>

                     <head>To measure things which have length and breadth, as Board, Glasse, Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Tyling, Wainscot, and such like.</head>
                     <p>THese things are all measured after the same way; onely there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the measure by which they are measured. For Board and Glass are measured by the foot; Wains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot, Pavements, and Tyling, by the yard.</p>
                     <pb n="853" facs="tcp:37680:89"/>
                     <p>Now in measuring any of these, as Inch, Foot, or Yard, is not onely so much in length, but so much in breadth too, that is, so much square; or if it lacks of it one way, it must be made up the other way. So that upon this account there is

                           <item>9 <hi>square feet in one yard.</hi>
                           </item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now in the measuring of any of these things, you must consider what forme or fashion it is of; and accordingly there are severall rules.</p>
                     <p>First, for Boards, they are usually cut out in long squares. And to measure such, you must first take the breadth thereof in Inches, and likewise the length thereof in Inches; and multiply them one by the other; so you shall have the content thereof in Inches: then to know how many feet it is; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this number by 144, the square in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in one foot, and the quotient will shew the number of feet; and if any
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37680:90"/>thing remain, it is so many square In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; which you may value by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <table>
                           <row>
                              <cell>10</cell>
                              <cell>60</cell>
                           </row>
                        </table>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thus for example:</hi> Suppose a Board to be 10 Inches broad, and 5 foot, or 60 Inches long: Multiply 60 by 10, it makes 600, which divided by 144, the quotient will be 4, and there remains 24. So that the board is four feet, and two thirds of one quarter of a foot.</p>
                     <p>This is the usuall forme of boards; onely sometimes they are a little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowet at one end then at the other; is his case you may take the bredth in the middle of the board; and then do, as before.</p>
                     <p>But because most men have not skill thus to divide and multiply; therefore they make use of Tables and lines set upon rules, shewing how many Inches in length fitted to any breadth wil make
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37680:90"/>a foot; and so by their Compasses or Ruler, they try how many times the said quantity is conteined in the length of that board, and reckon it to be so many foot long. This way is ancient, and is much used; and I no wayes finde fault therewith: and the Tables hereof are so common, that I shall not need to set them down. Onely for variety, and in conformity to some following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, I shall present you with this new Table of Board-measure, which may be used as it stands in the book, or drawn into a line, and set upon a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>

                     <p>Some use Chains of four or more Poles long, and divide them, as their fancy pleaseth; I shall onely shew you how to do it by Poles.</p>
                     <p>But now since every field and parcel of Land hath almost a different forme: I shall shew you first, how to measure some of the generall and common forms; and then how to reduce others thereunto.</p>

                        <p>THis is one of the most common formes, and most easily to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. The measuring hereof is, as I shewed before, in the board. For whether it be a long square, as that was, or that the sides be every way equal, as this is: Multiply one of the sides by another of the sides next unto it, (not opposite to it) and the product shewes the content in Poles; which divided
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37680:93"/>by 160, will give the content in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres.</p>

                           <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Thus, let the square <hi>A B C D</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a piece of Land, being 40 Poles square each way. Then 40 multiplied by 40, make 1600, and this divided by 160, yields 10, which shews the piece of Land is just 10 acres.</p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:37680:94"/>
                        <p>But now if this square were longer one way then another; as suppose the upper half of it, <hi>A B E F.</hi> Here now <hi>A B</hi> is 40 Poles, but <hi>A E</hi> is but 20; these two multiplied, make 800; and this divided by 160, yieds 5 acres.</p>
                        <p>But here note, that every four-sided piece of Land is not square, neither can thus be measured; therefore these four-sided irregular figures may best be reduced into two Triangles, and so measured, as in the next.</p>

                        <p>THough there are few parcels of Land lie in this forme, yet this is the most common form which is measured; because almost all parcels of Land must be reduced into these Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles before they can be measured.</p>

                        <p>Observe which is the longest side, and then measure how many Poles it is from the angle opposed to that side by the neerest way that you can, (which is perpendicularly) to that long side; as is represented by the pricked line in the Triangle following. Then multiply the halfe of this line by the whole long line; or the halfe of the long line by the whole of this line, as you shall see most convenient; and so you shall have the content of the Triangle in poles, which you may reduce into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>Thus, suppose the longest side of the Triangle to be 60 Poles; and the prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or perpendicular line 20 Poles. You may multiply either 60 by 10, or 20 by 30, the product is 600, which divided

                        <p>THere is much ado made about this, and yet but little use thereof; for very little Land falls out to be exactly in this forme.

                        <p>The rule, in brief, for the measuring of a Circular piece of Land is this, Multiply half the compasse by half the Diameter.</p>
                        <p>Note, the Diameter is a line drawn crosse the midst of the Circle.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the Diameter being 14 Poles, and the compasse 44: the halfe of both these is 7 and 22; which multiplied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yield 154 Poles, which lacks onely six Poles of an Acre.</p>

Now the most common and best form into which you may reduce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny piece of ground, is to lay it out in severall Triangles: and this you may do either in the field it self, (if it be not very great) or else you must draw a plot of the field, and so draw severall fines overthwart it; which may divide it into as few Triangles (taking in the whole) as possible may be: and then finding the content of these severall

                     <p>Which is the content of the whole field; the which if you divide by 160, to bring it into acres, shewes 6 acres, 1 rod, 2 poles, and 12 parts.</p>
                     <p>The most difficult task in this work is to finde the true length of the perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars, especially if you measure it in the field it self, which must alwayes be taken very exactly.</p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:37680:100"/>
                     <p>To which purpose, there will be need of two persons to help one another.</p>
                     <p>Thus, if you would finde the length of the perpendicular <hi>B G,</hi> in the Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>A B C.</hi> Let one party stand at the angle <hi>B,</hi> and let the other go from <hi>A</hi> toward <hi>C,</hi> as directly as he can. Now he that stands at the angle <hi>A</hi> will plainly see whether the other swerveth to the right or left never so little, and must direct him; this must be his part in the work. The other man that walks from <hi>A</hi> toward <hi>B,</hi> must carefully observe when he comes just against the angle <hi>B,</hi> that it may be just upon his side, which will be when he is at <hi>G,</hi> from whence measuring up to <hi>B,</hi> he shall have the true length of the line <hi>G B.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you have a plot of the field in paper, then you need onely take your compasses, and setting one foot in <hi>B,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the other, so that it may touch the line <hi>A C</hi> in the neerest place thereto, which is in <hi>G,</hi> then measure this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance upon your Scale of Poles, and so you shall have the length thereof.</p>
                     <p>By this you may perceive, that if you
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37680:101"/>can draw a true plot of the field in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it will be a great help to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring thereof. This may be easily done by many Instruments, and those which have skill to use them. Or if a man have but a Ruler with Sights, and some convenient device to serve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a stool or table in the field, that so he may lay a sheet of paper thereon, he may draw the foresaid lines to the severall angles of the field; and so measuring the length of them, prick them down with his compasses, and drawing the boundary lines, he shall have the true plot of the field.</p>
                     <p>If this also be wanting, yet with a little more labour in measuring, you may thus perform it with your Ruler and Compasses.</p>
                     <p>First, being at the angle A, measure the side AB, noting it down in your book, as also the point of the Compasse which it tends to, which for this purpose you may guesse at neer enough, if you have any skill therein, or else make use of any Sun-diall with a needle and compasse. Then likewise measure the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37680:101"/>line BC, noting the length thereof, and the point of the compasse it tends neerest to. Thirdly, measure from C to A, and thus you have the three sides of the Triangle ABC.</p>
                     <p>Having these three sides, you may with your Ruler and a pair of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, thus set out this Triangle in any paper. First, drawing the line AC, and setting off the length thereof out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scale of equall parts, make two points at the ends thereof at A and C. Then taking the length of the line A B out of the Scale, set one foot of your Compasses in A, and with the other make a little arch at B. And then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the length of the line BC out of the Scale, set one foot of your compasses in C, &amp; with the other crosse the foresaid arch at B; so drawing the lines A B, and BC, you shall have the Triangle ABC truly drawn upon the paper.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, measuring the side C D, and the breadth of the field from A to D; and setting off the length of these two lines from the points A and C, as before; so you shall have the one
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37680:102"/>half of the field truly drawn.</p>
                     <p>Then measuring the side DE, and the breadth A E, from the points A and D you may make the angle at E, and so set of another part of the field con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </figure>
                     <p>Lastly, measure the sides of the field EF and AF, and therewith from the points A and E, make the angle at F.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have all the angles of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37680:102"/>field, so that by drawing the lines from angle to angle, you have the true forme thereof, and the lines which you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured crosse the field will be of great use in casting up the content thereof, being the bases of four Triangles; so that you have nothing to measure but the perpendiculars, which you may finde out by your Scale, or now see how to measure them more exactly in the field it self.</p>
                     <p>The fittest Instrument used for this purpose is the Plain Table; which, for a shift, you may imitate with any Ruler with sights upon it, placing this Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at one corner of the field, as at A, you must turn the Ruler to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall angles B, C, D, E, F, and draw the lines AB, AC, AD, AE, AF; then measure those distances, and setting of the length thereof by your Scale and Compasses; so you shall have the exact proportion of the field.</p>
                     <p>Or if you think this measuring too much labour, you may do thus, having taken the proportion of the angles at A, as before, you need measure onely
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37680:103"/>any one of the lines (but the most op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to it is the best) as AD; then set up your Instrument at D, and set off the length of the line AD 39 poles, 66 parts out of your Scale from A to D; make this D your Centre-point, and so turning your Instrument, that the line DA may point directly to the angle at A, move your Ruler about to the other angles C, B, F, E, and draw the lines DC, DB, DF, DE, and where these lines crosse the foresaid lines, there lies the true place and posture of these bounds of the field, And if you have a care to draw these lines exactly, you may by your Scale and Compasses mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the length of any of these lines, almost as exactly as in the field it self.</p>
                     <p>And thus also at two stations, you may draw the plot of any larger piece of ground, or the platform of an whole Countrey, with the true distances of all the Towns and Villages therein, which you can see from both these places.</p>
                     <p>But many times it falls out, that in measuring great places, or Woods, or Hilly grounds, you can see but few of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37680:103"/>these angles at once. In this case, you must go round about the wood or field, measuring the sides thereof from angle to angle, and by your Instrument very diligently observing the quantity or proportion of these angles: So you shall have the true Symmetry of the field upon your paper, which you may divide into Triangles, and so finde the true quanity thereof, as before.</p>
                     <p>But these things require a larger Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I have onely given you a taste; if you please, you may be better instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by those who have written at large, and expresly hereof, as Mr. <hi>Rathborn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Diggs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Leybourn</hi> in his <hi>Compleat Surveyour.</hi>

                     <head>Of the measuring of Solid Bodies.</head>
                     <p>IN the measuring of Timber, Stone, and such like solid bodies, there must be respect had not onely to the breadth and length, but also to the thicknesse. And there are many common rules used in the measuring of these things, which deserve some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                     <p>First, herein you must know, that a foot of Timber is a foot square every way, <hi>viz.</hi> in length, breadth, and thicknesse: so that it is twelve times more then a foot of Board; a foot of Board being but 144 Inches, but a foot of Timber is 1728 Inches; and every Inch is square, like a Die, and so is the foot also supposed to be; or if it want of this, either in breadth, or in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37680:104"/>it must have it in length: so that in what forme soever it be, you must rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon thus:
<list>
                           <item>1728 <hi>square Inches make one Foot.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>864 <hi>square Inches make half a Foot.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>432 <hi>square Inches make a quarter of a Foot.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The most common shape which Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is brought into before it be measured is a long Square, having equall fides; for Trees growing, for the most part, round, by cutting off from each fide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, they come readily into this Square.</p>
                     <p>Now to finde the content of such a piece of squared Timber, you must mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the Inches of the breadth by the inches of the thicknesse, and then mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply this product by the inches of the length; so you shall have the whole so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid content in Inches, which if you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by 1728, the Inches in one foot; the quotient will shew you how many feet are in the piece of Timber.</p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:37680:105"/>
                     <p>But this way, though very exact, may seem somewhat too tedious, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, who have daily use hereof, have Tables and Lines upon their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, by which having measured the Square of the Tree, they know how much in length will make a foot of Timber; and so taking out this with their Compasses, they measure how many times that length is found in the length of the piece of Timber; and so conclude it to be so many feet.</p>
                     <p>This way, as I shall not speak against it, so it is so common, that I need not set down the Tables thereof; but shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with this new Table, which you will finde somewhat more ready and exact, especially if you use your pen.</p>

                        <p>AS the common tables of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-measure, shew how many Inches and parts make a foot of Timber, the Timber being any number of Inches square; so this shewes you by the square of the Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log in Inches, how many feet, or 1000 parts of a foot are contained in one foot length thereof.</p>
                        <p>Now because some may desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large this Table, that so it may shew not onely for the squares of Inches and half Inches, but the quarters, or tenth parts of Inches: (though these may be well enough by the proportion between the Inches and half Inches) yet I shall shew you the ground-worke of the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37680:106"/>Table, and so you may inlarge it at pleasure.</p>
                        <p>A foot of Timber, you all know, ought to be 12 Inches square every way, <hi>viz,</hi> 12 inches in breadth, 12 inches in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and 12 inches in length. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this proportion will follow,

                        <p>If you think this somewhat too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, you may leave out the last figures of the number, and work onely by 100 parts of a foot.</p>
                        <p>Now for the more readinesse, and also for the more exactnesse, you may project this Table of Timber-measure into a line upon your Ruler, in such a manner, that it shall serve better then the former Table,</p>

                        <p>But because the foresaid Table falls out in odde parts, which will be very troublesome to divide; therefore it will be worth the while, to finde how many inches and parts any certain number of the parts of this line will require, which you may thus finde, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the following Table, as you please.</p>
                        <p>Take the number 144 for 1000 parts, or 12 inches, as before, and multiply it by the parts you desire, and extract the square Root out of the product: note, if it fall not out in equall parts, adde some ciphers to it, that so you may have the fraction in a thousand parts at least.</p>

                        <p>NOw the use of this line being ser upon your Ruler, will be very ready. For measuring the side of any square piece of Timber, you need never look how many Inches square it is, but the line it self, counting from the right end thereof, will give you the number, which you must multiply by the length of the piece of Timber, measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in feet and hundred parts.</p>
                        <p>Thus, as before, finde the side of a piece of Timber to reach to 2.250 in this line, and the length thereof to be 25 foot, the content thereof is 56 feet and 250 parts, or a quarter of a foot.</p>

                     <p>THough this be the common forme of Timber, after the first hewing, yet many times by some accident, or by after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sawing, there are many pieces of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thicker one way then another.</p>
                     <p>Now in this case it is usuall with some men to adde the broader and the narrower sides together, and so to take the half thereof for the true Square.</p>
                     <p>But this must not alwayes be so slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, lest you run into great errour. For though the errour will be little, when the difference between the sides is not much; yet the greater that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, the greater will be the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let the sides of the Timber be to Inches, and 12 Inches; these two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together, make 22, the half where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is 11; but yet this is not the true square thereof: for 11 times 11 is 121; whereas 10 times 12 is 120, which is the true Area of the said square. Yet here the difference being but one inch in 120, may seem somewhat tolerable.</p>
                     <p>But now let the sides of the Timber be 12 inches one way, and 6 the other way; these two added together, make 18, and the half thereof is 9. Now the square of 9 is 81; but the true square of the Timber is found by multiplying 12 by 6. so the are a is 72. Here you see the errour will be intolerable. And it is so much the more unconscionable, because it gives the buyer so much lesse then his due.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Bedwell</hi> hath framed a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Ruler for this purpose, if it be carefully made.</p>
                     <p>But the best way is to multiply the two sides, and so finde the true area of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37680:111"/>the plain; and then by this Table, which you may also project into a line upon your Ruler, finde out the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <head>To measure round Timber.</head>
                     <p>THe way commonly used is to gird these round pieces of Timber about with a string, and so doubling the string, to take the fourth part thereof for the true square.</p>
                     <p rend="indent">
                        <hi>As for Example.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the compasse of the Tree be 48 Inches, they reckon 12 Inches for the true square thereof.</p>
                     <p>But this is very false,, as you may see by this little Circle, casting it up after the common way.</p>
                     <p>The Diameter of the Circle is 14 inches, the compasse is 44 inches. This is, according to that rule,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As</hi> 7, <hi>to</hi> 22:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>So the Diameter, to the Compasse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:37680:113"/>

                        <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                     </figure>
                     <p>Then for the content of this Circle, if you multiply half of the compasse, which is 22; by half of the diameter, which is 7; the true content will be 154 Inches.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if you had taken a quarter of the compasse, which is 11, for the square root of the circle; this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in it self, would yield but 121 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; which wants 33 inches of the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37680:113"/>true content: so there would be lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a fifth part thereof. And thus there will be in measuring any other round Timber, by this rule, of what compasse soever it be, somewhat above a fifth part thereof will be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                     <p>All that can be said in the defence of this custome, is that though most Trees grow round, yet they must be hewed square, before they be fit Timber for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny use almost; and so this advantage in the measure may very well be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that which goes to waste in the chips being good for nothing but the fire.</p>
                     <p>And in my minde, though Carpenters think not of this excuse, but take this rule for an absolute truth; yet this, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, was the first occasion of this Rule, which may stand with some good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For if you consider the former circle, the compasse being 44 inches, the inscribed square will be scarce 10 inches, as appears by this proportion, which you may use for any other;

As for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Timber, and the waste thereof, men must consider that in the price of the Foot or Tun; and so I believe they do: and therefore being allowed for the waste in the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there is no reason but they should pay for the full measure which they have, and not have any allowance in that also.</p>
                     <p>But many desire to buy Timber round, and will give as great a price for it as for square Timber, because of the allowance which they take to themselves in the measure. For first, they compasse the Tree, and divide the line into three parts, casting away one third part for the waste of the bark and rinde: then the other two parts of the line they divide into four parts, and so take one quarter thereof for the true square. Thus in the foresaid Tree, whose compasse was 48 Inches, a third
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37680:115"/>thereof, 16 inches allowed for waste, there remains but 32, and then a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this is but 8 inches, whereas you see before, this Tree will make a perfect square of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 10 inches, and all the other which is cut off will not be quite lost; so that they will have at least the one half of the Timber by this way of allowance and false measure.</p>
                     <p>Therefore by the way you may take notice of the different value which there ought to be, between good cleer timber perfectly squared, and that which is not. The difference between the content of the circle, and the square which may be wrought out of it, as you may see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is above one third part.</p>
                     <p>But because all this, especially in great trees, need not go to chips &amp; waste; you may well in such large round timber, reckon a fifth part for waste, and so the price of five feet thereof to be equall to four feet of square Timber; and in lesser pieces you may reckon a quarter for the waste, and so four feet thereof to be worth as much as three, and so let it be measured to the full content thereof.</p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:37680:115"/>
                     <p>Therefore novv I shall, as briefly as I can, shevv you the readiest vvayes to finde the true content of any round piece of Timber.</p>
                     <p>And you may finde this out either by the Diameter, or by the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                     <p>If you work by the Diameter, the rule is this;

                     </p>
                     <p>If you vvork by the compasse of the circle, vvhich I think vvill be best and most ready to be found, then take this rule:

                     </p>
                     <p>And thus having found the content or Area of the circle, you may by the Table (<hi>page</hi> 198) finde hovv many feet are in one foot length thereof.</p>
                     <p>Or you may work this somevvhat shorter, thus;

                     <p>And according to this rule, I have framed this Table; to help those that are not so ready in these operations, and so might fall into some mistake. By which taking only the compasse of the timber, they may know the quantity of the length of a foot thereof.</p>

                        <p>Thus, a piece of Timber 48 inches in compasse, and 20 foot long is 25 feet, 460 parts.</p>

                        <p>This Table may be also dravvn into a line or tvvo upon a Ruler, but I want time to shew how, therefore I shall leave it to the Artist himself, who shall have most occasion for it.</p>

                     <head>To measure Tapering Timber.</head>
                     <p>TApering timber, according as the base thereof is either round, or right lined, is either a Cone, or a Pyramide, or a segment of one of these.</p>
                     <p>If it be a compleat Cone or Pyramide having but one base, and ending in a sharp point, then you must multiply the Area of the base by a third part of the heigth.</p>
                     <p>Thus, suppose the four-square Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide A B C to be 45 foor long, and 18 inches square at the base. You shall finde by the Table of Timber-measure (<hi>page</hi> 185) that 18 inches square yield for the content of one foot length, 2 feet, 250 parts: this multiplied by 15 feet, which is one third of the length thereof, makes 33 feet, 750 parts.</p>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:37680:118"/>
                     <p>Thus the whole Pyramide is easily measured.</p>

                     </figure>
                     <p>But now suppose there were onely a part thereof to be measured, <hi>viz.</hi> D K B C, being 30 foot long from D to B, being six inches square at D, and 18 inches square at B, as before.</p>
                     <p>The common way used herein is to finde out the square in the very middest thereof, and to work by that, as if it were the true square, but this way, though it be true in flat, as boards, or land, yet here it yields al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes somewhat lesse.</p>

                     <p>For, according to this rule, the square in midst at F is 12 inches, and so the piece of Timber should be 30 foot long. But this is not the truth.</p>
                     <p>For proof hereof, these two parts of the Pyramide A D and D B must, as you saw before, make up 33 feet, 750 parts.</p>
                     <p>But the top of the Pyramide A D, measured by the true rule, makes but 1 foot, 250 parts. For the base thereof D K being 6 inches square,

                     <p>As I have shewed you how to do with this square Tapering-Timber, so you may by the round Tapering-Timber, working by the Table of round Timber (<hi>page</hi> 207.) Also you may see how to measure any other many-sided Pyramis. But I have been already too long in these things: onely the usefulnesse hereof (all Timber being almost of this fashion) and the errors of many herein, and the little which hath been written hereof by others, hath made me the more large.</p>

                     <p>Thus, suppose a piece of Timber or Stone to be 48 inches square. This Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reacheth but to 36 inches square; therefore take the half of your number, which will be 24, and this in the Table gives you 4 feet, 000 parts; and this is the quantitie of one quarter of a foot length thereof; so that if you multiply it by 4, it makes 16 feet, which is the content of one foot length of that piece of Timber: and so work, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p>THere is not much difference (in the thing it self) from measuring of other solids; onely they are measured by feet and inches; these by gallons, quarts, and pintes, or tenth parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>There are two things herein chiefly necessary, yet both much controverted.</p>
                     <p>First, these Vessels being all of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular formes, how to reduce them to a regular proportion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to finde the true quantity of the Gallon in cubick Inches, or parts of a foot.</p>
                     <p>For the first of these, the best way is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:37680:122"/>this, according to Mr. <hi>Oughtred.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Measure the Diameter of the Vessel both at the bung, and at the head thereof; and by the Diameters finde out the Area of the circles. Then take two thirds of the Circle at the bung, and one third of the circle of the head, and adde them together: and lastly, multiply the sum thereof by the length of the vessel.</p>
                     <p>For the second thing, the content of our English Gallon, which is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all these vessels. This is most commonly received, that a Wine-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon conteins 231 cubick inches: yet Mr. <hi>Wybard</hi> pleads very strongly, that it is somewhat lesse, making the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallon to be 225 inches. But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference being so small, the errour will not be much; and therefore, till the exact truth be more certainly known, I shall, with the most, follow the first; counting it better to allow rather a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle over-measure, then any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                     <p>And so according to these rules and observations I have Calculated this Table, and framed this Gauging-line; the use whereof is one and the same, and they will serve to help each other.</p>

                        <p>THis Table and Gauging-line have one and the same ground, <hi>viz.</hi> this received Theoreme, that one third of the Area of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle at the head; and two thirds of the Area at the circle at the bung added together, and multiplied by the length of the Vessel, gives the true content thereof.</p>
                        <p>But now it being troublesome to finde this out at length; <hi>viz.</hi> first the Area of the Circles, and then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Vessel in cubick inches; and lastly, to reduce this into Gallons: therefore the Table shews you one third and two thirds of the Area of any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ready cast up in the parts of a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon for any Diameter to 60 inches,

                        <p>This line therefore, though the figure is but four inches long, yet the twelve

                        <p>This line also shewes onely a third part of the Area of the Circle, whose Diameter is measured thereby; so it is properly to be used onely in measuring the Diameters at the heads.

                           <p>And thus this troublesome businesse is very easily performed, without any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation of Diameters, or Reduction of measures; which with some confidence I dare present to the candid censure of the better learned, and to the practice of others.</p>
                           <p>But though this operation by this line is performed easily, yet the making of this line, will at the first be some trouble, unlesse you know how to finde
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37680:127"/>out some certain equall numbers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi> every 5 or 10; otherwise, you will never divide the line either truly, or handsomely by the former Table.</p>
                           <p>Now to finde out these parts, you may remember that 1133, or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, the third part of 34 was the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by which the Table was framed. So that,</p>

                           <p>This number, or six of the first fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures thereof, you must multiply by the parts you desire, and then extract the Square root (as before in the line of Timber-measure) so you may inlarge this Table, and draw this Gauging-line very exactly thereby, having an Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line upon your Rule, divided into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimall parts.</p>

                           <head>Of the measuring of Ale or Beer-Vessels.</head>
                           <p>TO measure Ale or Beer-Vessels, your best way will be to make the like Tables and Line as for Wine-measure; and so the practice will be all one.</p>
                           <p>But first, you must know the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Ale-gallon, concerning which there are divers reports and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Some ancient Artists, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwyn,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> affirme, that the proportion between the Ale-gallon and the Wine-gallon is as 4 to 5; the Wine-gallon being 231 inches, and the Ale-gallon 288 ¾. This, by Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> is much lessened, being suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him to be but 272 inches, and ¼ and Mr. <hi>Wybard</hi> lessens it somewhat more, making it at the most but 270 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37680:129"/>But so far as I can learn, there are three sorts of measures in use. The measure for Wine being 231 inches; the measure for dry things, as Corn, &amp;c. being about 272; and the measure for Beer and Ale being 288 inches and ¾ The proportion between these three Gallons is 28, 33, 35; but having lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to do with the middle Gallon, I shall take the Ale-gallon to be 288 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ¾, and conclude the proportion between the Wine and Ale-gallon to be exactly as 4 to 5.</p>
                           <p>Now therefore if you have much, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to gauge Beer-vessels, for your readie use, you may thus make the like Tables and Line as you did for Wine-measure:

                           <p>Lastly, there is one thing in this bufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Gauging, which you must be very carefull of; and that is, of taking the true length of the Vessel between the inside of the two heads. This must be very exactly done; for since you must multiply your other summes by this, a small errour herein may cause you to give the content a Gallon more or lesse then you ought. But how to do this, I hope, is better known to the Practitioners hereof then I can declare with many words. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spoken what I think will be more new and useful to them, I shall here end these Artificiall Experiments, and proceed to some more common conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which may be of more general use to all men.</p>

                     <head>A way to try Gold, whether it he true or counterfeit.</head>
                     <p>BEcause there is much false Gold, which is so cunningly contrived, that the truth can searce be found out by the Touch-stone; and yet it is not good to deface any piece, except one be sure it is counterfeit, I shall shew how you may try the truth of a piece of Gold more certainly, then by a Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; and also without defacing the piece any manner of way.</p>
                     <p>The triall is thus, vveigh your tvven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shillings piece of Gold, as you use to do, and put in a grain or tvvo to make the scales even, then provide a pale vvith vvater, let the vvater be about three inches deep, and put your seales vvith the piece of Gold, and the brass vveight in them into the vvater; let them stand a little in the bottome of the pale, and then lift them up gently an inch or tvvo from the bottome; and then the Gold, if it be good, vvill out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveigh the brasse vveight ten or tvvelve grains, though before out of the vvater
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:37680:133"/>they were equal: And so proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ten shillings plece will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh his brass weight five or six-grains, and the five shil lings piece his weight two or three grains,</p>
                     <p>Now if you would know the cause hereof, it is because Gold quantity for quantity is the heaviest of all metalls: so that if you should cast 7 bullets of these 7 metalls in one and the same mould, their weights will have this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion one to another.</p>

                     <p>So that Gold is about a third part heavier then Lead, and about an half part heavier then Silver or Brasse: and therefore a plece cannot be made of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these metalls, but it must be much bigger in bulk then Gold, so that it may partly be suspected by the bredth or thicknesse.</p>
                     <p>But now the water will certainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the difference. For this is a rule in the Art Statick, that every thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:37680:134"/>the water loseth so much of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per weight as the quantity of so much water doth weigh, which is equall to bulk or quantity of their bodies, and so the Gold being not half the quantity of the Brasse, and yet being of equall weight with the Brasse, doth not lose half so much of his proper weight, as the Brasse will: so that if the Gold lose about 10 grains of its proper weight, the Brasse will lose above 20 of its proper weight; and so the Gold comes to be above 10 grains heavier then the Brasse, though out of the water they be of equal weight.</p>
                     <p>But now the best way to try your Gold this way, if you have any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, is thus; Put a piece in the one scale, of whose goodnesse you are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and put the other pieces severally in the other, and make them equall, by putting in a grain or two; then put your scales in the water, and weigh them therein; and if they keep equall weight both in the water and out of the water, you may be confident they are both of one metal.</p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:37680:134"/>
                     <p>And thus you may try the truth of Gold in any other things, as Rings, or such like. Thus it is recorded, that <hi>Archimedes</hi> found out how much the Goldsmith had couzened King <hi>Hiero,</hi> in making of a golden Crown, by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Brasse amongst it.</p>

                     <head>The use of the two fore-going Tables of the Assize of Bread.</head>
                     <p>To know the true Assize of Bread, according to the Statute, you must first know the price of Wheat, which must be neither of the very best, nor worst, but of the common sort.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You must consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Baker which sells the bread live in a City or Corporation, and is a Free-man thereof: or whether he be a Forreigner and not free: for the Free-Bakers are by the Statute allowed two shillings upon the Quarter (that is, three pence upon the Bushel) more profit then the Forreigners.</p>
                     <p>This considered, if you finde the price of Wheat in the side of the Table, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of the Baker, whether Free or not Free, then in the same line you shall finde the weight of the Peny White, wheaten, &amp; Houshold loaf.</p>
                     <p>Now in the first Table this weight of the bread is set down in Troy-weight, which hath 12 Ounces in the pound,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37680:136"/>and 20 Peny-weights in each Ounce, This is the weight appointed by the Statute to weigh bread by.</p>
                     <p>But because every one hath not this Weight, I have therefore added the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table, which shews the very same with the former in <hi>Avoir-du-pois</hi> weight (which is more common) and this hath 16 Ounces in the pound, and 8 Drams in every Ounce. Now it hath been found that 13 of these Ounces are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to one pound or 12 Ounces <hi>Troy</hi>-weight, and according to this proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this second Table is made.</p>
                     <p>Now the Law is very strict against all Bakers in case of offending in this and some other particulars. For if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor or Bailiffe of any Town finde their bread to be made lighter, they may take it away, and give it to the poor of the said Town. And by the Statute of 51 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. If a Baker want but one ounce in 36, of this Assize, the fourth time he shall suffer the Pillory without fine or red emption.</p>

                        <p>BY this Table, knowing the price of one pound of any thing, you may know how much the Hundred weight (being 112 pound) comes to. Or, having bought any thing by the hundred weight, you may know how to retail it again by the pound. Thus if one pound of any thing cost 4 pence, 3 farthings, a hundred weight of the same commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity will cost 2 pound, 4 shillings, and 4 pence. Also, if a hundred weight of any thing cost 4 pound, 6 shillings, 4 pence, the price of one pound thereof will cost 9 pence farthing: the like may be done for any other. But if your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity come to above 18 pence the pound, you may do it by the half of the price; or else reckon first for the 18 pence, and after for the rest of the price.</p>

                        <p>To finde out this, first look the price of the ell, at the head of the Table, then look down the side of the Table for the number of the ells, so you shall finde in the last columne but one of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:37680:142"/>Table, and in the last line but one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that 5000 of any thing at 11 pence a piece, comes to 229 <hi>li.</hi> 3 <hi>

                        <p>Now if you cannot finde your price in one columne, or your number of things in one line, you must make two or three parts thereof, and add them altogether, as in the Tables of Interest and Rebate before.</p>
                        <p>Thus, if you would know what 1500 ells at nine pence half peny come to.</p>
                        <p>First, in the Table of nine pence.</p>

                        <p>This Table of the Kings I suppose may be necessary in the searching out the antiquity of many old Evidences, which are dated many times by the yeers of the King then reigning, and not by the yeers of our Lord. And it might be more plain and profitable if it were drawn out a little larger, but time and paper are wanting: I have only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a patern shewn how it might be done in this hundred yeers last past, and added some brief notes out of History thereunto.</p>
                        <p>The use of this following Table will appear in such questions.</p>

But in <hi>July</hi> some of our Army get over the River in Boats, and overthrow a strong party of them. And most of the Army being afterward got over, march Northward toward S.
